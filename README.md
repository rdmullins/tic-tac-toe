*TIC-TAC-TOE* is a single-page web application that recreates the fun of the classic Xs and Os game!

### Installation
*TIC-TAC-TOE* is entirely web-hosted and runs in the browser of your choice. No installation required!

### Usage
Navigation is simple! The game play is point-and-click (or touch on mobile). Helpful messages on screen remind the players whose turn it is, and the program monitors for (and prevents) invalid moves and continually checks for end-game conditions. You can start over at any time by using the Reset button.

### Contributions
Pull requests via the *TIC-TAC-TOE* project's [public Github repository](https://github.com/rdmullins/mind-reader) are welcome!
